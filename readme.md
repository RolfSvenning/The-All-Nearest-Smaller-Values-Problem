ANSV2: All Nearest Smaller Values Problem
==========================================

Overview:
---------
The ANSV2 project is focused on solving the All Nearest Smaller Values (ANSV) problem, a fundamental problem in computational theory with a wide array of applications. In this problem, given an array A of n totally ordered distinct elements, the goal is to compute for each element in the array the indices of the nearest smaller values to its left and right.

This repository includes various algorithmic implementations to solve the ANSV problem efficiently, and highlights a range of applications.

Features:
---------
- Implementations of the ANSV problem using various algorithmic approaches:
- Sequential array-based solution with O(n) complexity.
- The Berkman, Schieber, and Vishkin Optimal solution.
- The original Shun and Zhao approach.

Dependencies:
-------------
- CMake (minimum required version 3.16).
- C++20 Standard for modern C++ features.
- ParlayLib (header-only library) for efficient parallel computations.
- Pthread library for multithreading support.

Building the Project:
---------------------
1. Ensure CMake (version 3.16 or higher) and a C++20 compliant compiler are installed.
2. Clone this repository to your system.
3. Ensure ParlayLib is cloned into your project. It's available on [GitHub](https://cmuparlay.github.io/parlaylib/).
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:
   cmake .
   make
4. This will compile the ANSV2 executable.

Usage:
------
- Execute the ANSV2 executable to run the algorithms.
- The main.cpp file serves as the entry point and can be modified to test different algorithms or inputs.

Applications of ANSV:
---------------------
The ANSV problem has numerous applications in various domains, including but not limited to:
1. Finding the min/max among n elements.
2. Merging sorted lists.
3. Constructing Cartesian trees.
4. Monotone polygon triangulation.
5. Range minimum queries.
6. Parenthesis matching.
7. Binary tree reconstruction.
